# Smart-Agriculture-using-Deep-Learning-Techniques
Here I use 7-8type of plants to vary in between them. Here the Dataset is 907mb(Source: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tywbtsjrjv/1). Here The Techinques I used are Tensorflow , Transfer Learning, numpy and matplotlib to take a predicted output. It will vary between the bad leaf and the good leaf.
